# Description
This project consists of a suite of simple utility applications developed using Python and PySimpleGUI. The goal is to become more comfortable with Python development while creating functional tools. This suite includes a variety of small, practical applications:

- Connverter
- Claculator
- Stopwatch

This project does not emphasize git proficiency. For a more comprehensive and challenging project, consider exploring the Project Euler repository, which offers complex programming problems and explores multiple languages, including Python, Java, C++, and Rust.
